                    <p>Farnaz bridal is the brainchild of Farzana Isack,a fashionable agriculturalist, stay-at-home
                        mom by profession, <br> who as a past-time, enjoyed designing and making clothes.</p>
                    <p>
                        Once her children flew the nest, she combined her past-time with her unique passion for
                        clothing, and teamed <br> up with just as
                        equally fashionable, entrepreneur Nazrana, and they opened their first store,hannan Styles:
                        an <br> occasions wear store for both men and women.
                        As the store grew, Farzana and Nazrana decided to incorporate <br> bridal wear at a small-scale.
                        This spacal farnaz interest in everything bride and beautiful,and at the end of 2016, <br>
                        farzana decided to branch out and mainly focus on bridal wear, and that’s when Farnaz opened
                        its own doors at <br>the Greenhouse Mall to meet the growing demand for bridal wear, hence the
                        birth of Farnaz: the name a <br>combination of her initials, “F” and “N”.</p>
